## About the Project

SolSmile is a Web3 application on Solana Devnet that rewards genuine smiles with USDC. The flow:

1. User uploads a selfie ðŸ“¸
2. AI (Gemini) analyzes the smile score
3. If the score â‰¥ 5 â†’ the user can claim 0.01 USDC from a public reward pool
4. Community members can donate USDC to this pool, funding future smiles

## Smart Contract Overview

Built using Anchor framework with Token Program for USDC transfers.

### Program Functions

- **initialize_pool** â†’ Creates a stats account to track total rewards & claims and initializes the pool PDA.
- **claim_reward** â†’ If a user's last claim wasn't today, transfers 0.01 USDC (10000 in 6 decimals) from pool to the user's token account.
- **donate** â†’ Allows anyone to transfer USDC from their token account to the pool token account.
